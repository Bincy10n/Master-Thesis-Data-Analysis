This repository contains the code and documentation for my master's final year thesis, focusing on the analysis of the impact of climate change on tourism in Ireland. The project combines data analytics techniques with domain knowledge to explore patterns, correlations, and insights related to climate and tourism data.

## Abstract:

Understanding the effects of climatic changes on diverse industries is crucial as the global climate continues to experience considerable transformations. With an emphasis on the Ireland, this study explores the complex interaction between climatic factors and tourism.We examined how different climatic variables such as wind speed, rainfall, and temperature, affect the amount of tourists visiting Ireland from different nations over a particular time period (2006 to 2019). In order to identify possible relationships and trends, a complex study was conducted using a comprehensive data set that included both climate and tourism data. This research mainly focus on data analysis process and help us learn more about how climate changes impact tourism in Ireland. Additionally, we can determine the precise climate factors that have a substantial impact on travel and learn more about how changes in the weather and temperature can affect preferences and attitudes of tourists.

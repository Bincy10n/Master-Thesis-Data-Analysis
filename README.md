## Climate-Tourism-Analysis  

This repository contains the code and documentation for my master's final year thesis, focusing on the analysis of the impact of climate change on tourism in Ireland. The project combines data analytics techniques with domain knowledge to explore patterns, correlations, and insights related to climate and tourism data.

## Abstract:

Understanding the effects of climatic changes on diverse industries is crucial as the global climate continues to experience considerable transformations. With an emphasis on the Ireland, this study explores the complex interaction between climatic factors and tourism.We examined how different climatic variables such as wind speed, rainfall, and temperature, affect the amount of tourists visiting Ireland from different nations over a particular time period (2006 to 2019). In order to identify possible relationships and trends, a complex study was conducted using a comprehensive data set that included both climate and tourism data. This research mainly focus on data analysis process and help us learn more about how climate changes impact tourism in Ireland. Additionally, we can determine the precise climate factors that have a substantial impact on travel and learn more about how changes in the weather and temperature can affect preferences and attitudes of tourists.

## Project Overview

- **Objective:** Investigate the correlation between climate factors and tourism patterns.
- **Tools Used:** R, Python,Excel.
- **Methodology:** Data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, statistical testing.
- **Insights:** Discovered patterns, trends, and statistical significance in the climate-tourism nexus.

## Dataset Overview

The analysis relies on data sourced from Ireland's Central Statistical Office (CSO) 1, the national statistical agency. The CSO aims to objectively collect, examine, and provide information on various aspects of the country, including people, society, and the economy.

**Data Sources**:
Climate Dataset: Extracted from the environment sector.
Tourism Dataset: Obtained from the business sector.

**Data Integration**:
The climate and tourism datasets, initially treated independently, were merged to capture the intricate relationship between climate and tourism in Ireland.

## Conclusion:

In conclusion,this study has revealed the significant information that clarifies the relationship between Ireland’s climate and tourism from 2006 to 2019.A thorough analysis has shown that temperature has a significant impact on travel behavior.While discovered wind and rainfall have no significance relation on the tourism in Ireland.This study compares correlation strategies and identifies
Spearman as the best option as compared to Pearson method, highlighting the importance of several methodologies in data analysis.Additionally, our findings revealed vacationers’ preference for the summer season.
